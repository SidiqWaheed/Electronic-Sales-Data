### Data Sources

The analysis is based on a dataset containing transactional data for electronic product purchases, sourced from the electronic sales market.

###Tools

Tableau (for data cleaning and visualization)

### Data Quality and Assessment/Cleaning
- The dataset has been cleaned and pre-processed to handle missing values and ensure consistency across fields. Key columns were selected to focus on performance metrics, customer demographics, and purchasing behavior.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) involved investigating key questions, such as:

- Which product type generates the highest total revenue?
- Which product is sold out most frequently?
- What is the shipping performance?
- What are the sales trends?
- Which gender purchases the most?
- What is the age distribution of customers?
- Which add-ons are purchased most frequently by total price?
- How does member loyalty impact total sales?
- What is the preferred payment type?

####Results and Findings

#### - Product Performance

Smartphones lead product performance, generating over $21 million in sales, followed by smartwatches at over $14 million and laptops at more than $12 million. Tablets contribute over $11 million, while headphones report the lowest sales at $4 million.

#### Shipping Performance
Standard shipping accounts for the highest revenue, exceeding $21 million. Expedited and same-day shipping each contribute over $12 million, while overnight and express shipping generate more than $8 million.

#### Order Status Performance
Of all orders, 67.02% were completed, while 32.98% were canceled. Further analysis is recommended to understand the reasons behind these cancellations and identify opportunities for improvement.

#### Sales Trend
Sales from January to September consistently remained above $5 million. However, a decline was observed in October, November, and December. It is suggested that the company enhance advertising and promotional efforts during these months to improve sales performance.

#### Age Distribution
Customers aged 20 to 75 have collectively spent over $4 million on products. The 15 to 19 age group contributed over $1 million, while customers aged 80 and above spent approximately $929,988.

#### Product Type by Quantity
Smartphones represent the highest quantity demanded at 29.77%, followed by tablets at 20.65%, smartwatches at 19.72%, and laptops at 19.67%. Headphones show the lowest demand at 10.19%.

#### Gender Distribution
Male customers account for the highest sales, exceeding $32 million, while female customers generate over $31 million.

#####Member Loyalty by Quantity
In terms of member loyalty, "No" ranks highest at 78.40%, while "Yes" accounts for 21.60%.

#### Recommendations

- Ensure High Product Quality: Maintain quality across all products to boost demand and overall sales performance.
- Enhance Advertising Efforts: Increase marketing initiatives during underperforming months (October, November, December) to attract potential customers.
- Investigate Cancellations: Analyze the reasons behind the 32.98% cancellation rate to enhance customer satisfaction and reduce losses.
- Optimize Marketing Strategies: Tailor marketing approaches for different age groups, particularly targeting younger customers aged 15 to 19 and the elderly aged 80 and above to encourage higher spending.
- Leverage Gender Insights: Develop gender-specific marketing campaigns to engage both male and female customers effectively.


### Conclusion
In summary, the analysis of sales performance, product demand, and customer demographics yields valuable insights into the company's operations. Smartphones lead in both sales and quantity demanded, indicating a strong market preference. However, underperforming months and product categories, particularly headphones, highlight areas for improvement. The significant order cancellation rate warrants further investigation to enhance customer experience and minimize losses. Targeted advertising and quality assurance can strengthen engagement across different age groups and genders. By implementing these recommendations, the company can optimize its strategies, boost sales, and foster long-term customer loyalty.
